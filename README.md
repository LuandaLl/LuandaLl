###

I am a Computer Engineering student and Industrial Automation Technician with experience in industrial processes, administrative routines, and technological development. I have worked at large companies such as Sabesp, Tasco, and Ethos Industrial, developing a practical perspective on production efficiency, systems integration, and process management.

Unique in combining industry experience with knowledge of technology and programming: Python, C++, JavaScript, GitHub Copilot, and Azure Machine Learning, enabling a holistic view of business and innovation.

Also volunteer on projects providing emotional support to the elderly, developing empathy, active listening, and social responsibility skills.

Seeking an intern or trainee in Computer Engineering, with an interest in automation, industrial technology, and software development, applying an integrated approach to industry and IT to generate efficiency, innovation, and sustainable results, as well as positive impacts.P.
>I'm passionate about computing and I share my knowledge on the YouTube channel [Luanda Lima](https://www.youtube.com/@LuandaLm) where I post the projects I'm currently working on.
